## 🧠 Why GoodEats?

Finding affordable, local food deals can be frustrating — especially when smaller, family-owned restaurants don’t advertise specials online. Budget-conscious students and community members often miss out on hidden gems simply because there’s no central hub for sharing these offers.

**GoodEats** solves this by creating a community-powered space where users can:

- 🧾 Share affordable dining deals
